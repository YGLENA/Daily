\begin{prop} Let $X$ be a topological vector space and $W$ be a neighborhood of $0$. Then there is a neighborhood $U$ of $0$ which is symmetric, which means $U=-U$, and which satisfies $U+U\subset W$.\marginnote{Repeating this proof, we can always take a symmetric neighborhood $U$ of $0$ such that $\underbrace{U+\cdots+U}_{2^n}\subset W$.}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $0+0=0$ and the addition is continuous, there are neighborhoods $V_1,V_2$ of $0$ such that $V_1+V_2\subset W$. Now take $U=V_1\cap V_2\cap -V_1\cap -V_2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} Let $X$ be a topological vector space, $K$ be a compact subset, and $C$ be a closed subset with $K\cap C=\emptyset$. Then $0$ has a neighborhood $V$ satisfying $(K+V)\cap (C+V)=\emptyset$.\marginnote{Since $K+V$ and $C+V$ are unions of open sets, it is open. Thus this theorem gives disjoint open sets that contains $K$ and $C$, respectively.}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof} If $K=\emptyset$ then $K+V=\emptyset$. Thus consider $K\neq \emptyset$ and choose $x\in K$. Considering the translational
