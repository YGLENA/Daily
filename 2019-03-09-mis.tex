\mytitle{Miscellaneous thing}
Today I was quite busy finishing my small paper about Nagaoka's theorem, which takes whole time today from 3 p.m.(It's 11:40 already). And I need to solve some problems on \textit{Quantum Phase Transitions} by Subir Sachdev. And I need to skim the \textit{Algebraic Topology} by Alan Hatcher to do the mathematical physics seminar. And I need to study category theory. And I need to solve the SSL problems and Luttinger's theorem and so on. It could go crazy if I did not enjoy all those things. (Actually it is going crazy)

Anyway. No more works today. Maybe some Autochess and sleep then.

For the work I've done today, see Nagaoka's Theorem file.
